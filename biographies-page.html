        <h3 class="bio-title">Esperanza Spalding</h3>
        Portland, Oregon-born jazz singer, bassist, and cellist Esperanza Spalding 
        displayed prodigious talents from an early age playing violin with the Chamber 
        Music Society of Oregon. She burst onto America’s jazz music scene with the 
        release of her debut album Junjo in 2006, receiving favorable reviews from the 
        likes of the New York Times’ critic Ben Ratliff. Since then, Spalding has gone 
        on to win multiple Grammys including Best New Artist of 2010—the first jazz 
        musician to be awarded this title—and Best Jazz Vocal Album for 2012’s Radio 
        Music Society. Her fifth studio album, Emily’s D+Evolution, is sung through the
        alter ego of Emily, Esperanza’s middle name, and has received widespread critical 
        acclaim since its release in March 2016.<br>

        <h3 class="bio-title">Christian Scott</h3>
        Hailing from New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz, 
        Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah’s trumpet playing is 
        awe-inspiring. While his music respects the origins of jazz, 
        it also includes a variety of influences. He fuses jazz with hip-hop, 
        African music, rock, and more. It seems his goal is to always 
        keep the listener on the edge of their seat, and he accomplishes 
        it in spades.<br>
